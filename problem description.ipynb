    "For example, when a person comes to Shanghai making a living for the first time, he needs to understand the geographical information and position situation in Shanghai, including the occupation he expects to engage in, which companies can provide relevant positions, and the company's treatment and salary. So, I want to take the **Data Analyst** as an example to explore the relationship between the salary situation and the geographical location of Shanghai, and help new people to choose their favorite job."

The location information of each venue refers to the basic and advanced information of the company. For example, one of the communities has a company. As the basic information, we can get its precise latitude and longitude as well as its distance from the neighborhood center.
