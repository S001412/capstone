    "For example, when a person comes to Shanghai making a living for the first time, he needs to understand the geographical information and position situation in Shanghai, including the occupation he expects to engage in, which companies can provide relevant positions, and the company's treatment and salary. So, I want to take the **Data Analyst** as an example to explore the relationship between the salary situation and the geographical location of Shanghai, and help new people to choose their favorite job."

Technically speaking, geographical location refers to the longitude and latitude of that administrative region. Let's assume it's Shanghai, China. In fact, we will first find Shanghai, China, and Shanghai districts such as Songjiang District and Huangpu District through the corresponding postal code, and map them with the company"

The location information of each venue refers to the basic and advanced information of the company. For example, one of the communities has a company. As the basic information, we can get its precise latitude and longitude as well as its distance from the neighborhood center. At the same time, we crawled the relevant specific information about data mining positions in Shanghai from the well-known domestic job search website, lago.com"

For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 1000 meter. It means that we have asked Foursquare to find venues that are at most 1000 meter far from the center of the neighborhood. (I think distance is measured by latitude and longitude of venues and neighborhoods, and it is not the walking distance for venues.)"
